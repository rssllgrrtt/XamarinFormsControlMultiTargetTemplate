# Xamarin Forms Control Multi-Target Template
 
I wanted to get my head around .NET Standard multi-targeting. I also wanted to have a simple template for a control with custom renderers (for Android and iOS) that I could just clone, rename and roll with. This does exactly that - no frills.

If this helps you understand multi-targeting like it did for me - that's cool. James Montemagno's guide on converting Xamarin libraries was a big help. https://montemagno.com/converting-xamarin-libraries-to-sdk-style-multi-targeted-projects/

Go there and throw James your support - he does great work.

If you want to add support for other platforms then go for it. Just be kind enough to submit a PR :)
